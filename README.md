**IPPC 2022 Redesign**

HTML &amp; CSS templates for the IPPC websiteâ€™s 2022 redesign. 

## Things To Do

New background for globalnavs of each color-coded section.

Consider removing border from main container. If we do this we need to think of a way to have footer images still look good when cropped, perhaps by keeping a border on the footer, or cropping the images differently.

IPPC logo on bottom-right of footer.

Templates for the following pages:

- News detail page
- Generic single detail page with title, text, image, table of documents, forms, etc
- Country page (contact info, photo thumbnail)
- Section pages with custom backgrounds for footer and globalnav.
- Homepage
